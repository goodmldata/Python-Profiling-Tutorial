    "**Profiler** is a program that runs an application and monitors functions execution time, thus detecting the function on which the application spends the most of its time.\n",

    "The Particle Simulator application simulates a scientific performance-intensive system. The application is capable to simulate the rotation of multiple particles over a central point. The particles angular rotation speed is constant. Each particle starts rotating from some predefined position, identified by the coordinates x and y. The users of the simulator want to be able to identify the position of any particle at any point of time.\n",
