    "A benchmark is a simple and representative script that can be run to assess the running time of the application. We have already written a benchmark script for our Particle Simulator. The benchmark script is located in the directory called **benchmarks**, and we already used this script when measuring the code run time with **timeit** module and with Unix **time** command.\n",

    "In order to demonstrate this technique I created a directory **tests/benchmarks** and added a benchmark script called **test_bm_particle_simulator.py**. The benchmark script creates a particle simulator with 10, 100, and 1000 particles, and then evolves the particles for 0.1 unit of time. Now if we run the tests, the benchmark scripts will run as well, and the benchmarks run time statistics will be displayed. \n",
